          Sa vama od 1990. godine

          You are a man named Henry who has retreated from your messy life to
          work as a fire lookout in the Wyoming wilderness. Perched atop a
          mountain, it's your job to find smoke and keep the wilderness safe.
          <br />
          An especially hot, dry summer has everyone on edge. Your supervisor, a
          woman named Delilah, is available to youat all times over a small,
          handheld radioâ€”and is your only contact with the world you've left
          behind.
          <br />
          But when something strange draws you out of your lookout tower and
          into the world below, you'll explore a wild and unknown environment,
          facing questions and making interpersonal choices that can build or
          destroy the only meaningful relationship you have.
